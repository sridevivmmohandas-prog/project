# Hyper-Personalized Customer Support Agent

## Overview
Retail customers today expect **instant, personalized answers**—from store hours to order status. Standard chatbots often provide generic responses, which fail to engage users.  

This project builds a **Hyper-Personalized Customer Support Agent** that understands **user context and history** to deliver specific, actionable responses.

**Example Scenario:**  
User: “I’m cold.”  
Bot: “Come inside the Starbucks 50m away. We have a 10% coupon for Hot Cocoa.”
